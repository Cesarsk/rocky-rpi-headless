## About

### Why do I need that?

To be able to access the device remotely (via `ssh`) since it's first boot.

Plug the network cable, the power cable and it's ready.

No need to plug screen nor keyboard to the device in order to do the first access.

### How it is done? 

The `rc.local` script runs after first boot assigning the manual static IP configuration and making sure `sshd` is running.
